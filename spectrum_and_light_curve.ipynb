    "### 1.3.2. A note on spectrum and flux point estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward folding**\n",
    "The spectrum fit and the flux points are done via a so-called forward folding. Remember that we learned about the conversion from the \"detector world\" to the \"physical world\" using the IRFs? Forward folding refers to the conversion from true to estimated energy, using the energy dispersion matrix. The inverse computation is called unfolding and would require to invert the matrix to convert from estimated to true energy. The second is what we really want to do, but it is a complex task, since the migration matrix is not invertable in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the use of forward folding?**\n",
    "In simple words, the spectrum fit is a broadband fit to a large interval of energies (with amplitude and spectral index as free parameters), while the flux points are obtained refitting the best-fit broadband spectral shape to each bin separately (this time only the amplitude as free parameter). The result of the broadband fit is a best-fit spectral model parametrized in true energy. This is the dashed line in our plot above. The flux points and their binning, however, are defined in estimated energy. Considering this and the fact that out plot above is showing true energy on the x-axis, we can say that it is not very correct to plot it like this, since the bin edges for the flux points are actually in estimated energy. We could put it like this: Computing flux points with the forward folding technique is a sanity check for our overall spectral shape. Let's consider a case in which the emission of a source has a cutoff at high energies, but we assumed a power law shape. We can fit this to our data and not realize that there is a slight inconsistency with the data at the highest energies because the overall fitted spectrum can only tell us rough features, not the fine details. But when we compute flux points we will notice that the ones at highest energies are not fluctuating around our fit but systematically lower, indicating a cutoff of the spectrum. This is what forward-folding flux points are useful for. To have a cross check of the overall shape of the spectrum, even if we should not take them too seriously in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technically how does it work?**\n",
    "In forward folding we assume a spectral shape of the source emission in the physical world (so parametrized in true energy). This spectral shape is parametrized in a model with a certain number of free parameters. To find the optimal values for the model we do the following: We start with an educated guess of the parameters and then iterate these steps...\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. We pass it through the IRFs (the energy dispersion matrix) and predict a count value in each bin of estimated energy (see plot below).\n",
    " 2. For each of these bins we have a poissonian probability distribution for the counts. We compute the likelihood as a product of all of these. The likelihood function tells us how probable the model with the corresponding parameters is, given our data. We aim to maximize it. \n",
