    "In the following Jupyter notebooks, we will analyse public data of the standard source at VHE gamma rays, the Crab Nebula. The notebooks also contain code to produce a light curve (LC) for the blazar PKS 2155-304, to be discussed if there is time, or you can go through it by yourself after the course, when you should have the tools and knowledge to produce an LC by yourself.\n",

    "[H.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/) is an array of 5 gamma-ray telescopes located in Namibia. The H.E.S.S. data is private, and H.E.S.S. analysis is mostly documented and discussed in the internal communication channels. However, in 2018, a small sub-set of archival H.E.S.S. data was publicly released, called the [H.E.S.S. DL3 DR1](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/dl3-dr1/), the data level 3, data release number 1. This is the observational data we will be using. The dataset contains observations of various sources with different types, such as a blazar, a pulsar wind nebula and a supernova remnant. You can check which observation (id) belongs to which source on the last three pages of [this](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/HESS/pages/dl3-dr1/hess_dl3_dr1.pdf) document.\n",

    "\n",
    "[MAGIC](https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/) are two IACTs on the canary island of La Palma, observing together in stereo mode since 2009. As for H.E.S.S., the data is private and is mostly analysed with a proprietary software, although it is possible to do a high-level analysis with Gammapy. Only recently the experiment has publicly released few observations of the Crab Nebula. We will not use these during the course but you may try solving the excercises at home, in which case you will also play with MAGIC data a bit."
